This project is ALPHA and it will probably always be. It is distributed without warranties, use it at your own risk :-)

Do you want to use it? Use it. 
Do you want to edit it? Edit it.
Do you want me to implement some features? Write me, if I'm in a good mood, have some time, and your idea is cool, I may implement it.

Oh and btw, I'm not gonna tell you what this project is for (but if you are playing in a wind band and you're looking for something to help you manage some stuff, this may be the right place. *may* ) :-)
